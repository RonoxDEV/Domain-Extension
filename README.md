##🌌 Project Unbound
Project Unbound is an ambitious Minecraft mod designed to push the boundaries of the vanilla experience. It introduces a high-fidelity Domain Expansion system inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, featuring advanced spatial manipulation and custom game physics.

✨ Key Features
[Domain Expansion]: 🌑 Infinite Void Mechanic: Deploy a massive, visually stunning spherical domain that overwrites the world. It features a custom 14-second expansion sequence with high-pitched ambient soundscapes and immersive fog.

[The Binding Vow]: ⚖️ Inviolable Pact: A robust security system that enforces the rules of the domain. Any entity attempting to escape the 30-block radius via teleportation or Ender Pearls is instantly executed with a custom death message.

[Duel System]: ⚔️ Isolation Logic: Upon activation, the domain identifies the nearest target and expels all other entities. The target is completely immobilized (Slowness & Jump Block) during the 31-second active phase, forcing a true 1v1 confrontation.

[Adaptive Physics]: 🧱 Dynamic Terrain Reconstruction: The engine replaces the floor with "Domain Occulte" blocks that are indestructible and self-regenerating. Once the domain ends (or the caster/target dies), the terrain is perfectly restored to its original state.
