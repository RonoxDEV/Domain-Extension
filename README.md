##🌌 Project Unbound
Project Unbound is an ambitious Minecraft mod designed to push the boundaries of the vanilla experience. It introduces a high-fidelity Domain Expansion system inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, featuring advanced spatial manipulation and custom game physics.

✨ Key Features🌌 DOMAIN EXPANSION
Domain Expansion is a cinematic combat mod for Minecraft that recreates with surgical precision the "Muryōkūsho" (Unlimited Void) territory expansion. This mod prioritizes high-end visual immersion, premium soundscapes, and absolute graphical fidelity.

✨ KEY FEATURES
[GRAPHICS & IMMERSION]: 🌑 Unlimited Void Rendering: A massive animated sphere featuring custom fog shaders. The incantation phase plunges the caster into a dark, nebulous void before revealing an "Occult" dome that completely rewrites the world's visual reality.

[CINEMATIC EFFECTS]: 💥 Deployment Impact: The mod integrates a custom Screen Shake system and shockwave particles (Sonic Booms) during both deployment and collapse, providing a raw sensation of overwhelming power.

[TECHNICAL COMBAT]: ⚖️ The Binding Vow: Strict spatial rules are enforced. Any entity attempting to breach the barrier via teleportation or ender pearls is instantly executed. Upon activation, the domain isolates a single target and subjects it to total immobilization (Infinite Stasis).

[REALITY RESTORATION]: ⏳ Spatial Reconstruction: The domain physically overwrites the terrain with indestructible blocks. Once the timer expires or the caster/target dies, a fluid 8-second animation retracts the sphere and perfectly restores the original world.

[Domain Expansion]: 🌑 Infinite Void Mechanic: Deploy a massive, visually stunning spherical domain that overwrites the world. It features a custom 14-second expansion sequence with high-pitched ambient soundscapes and immersive fog.

[The Binding Vow]: ⚖️ Inviolable Pact: A robust security system that enforces the rules of the domain. Any entity attempting to escape the 30-block radius via teleportation or Ender Pearls is instantly executed with a custom death message.

[Duel System]: ⚔️ Isolation Logic: Upon activation, the domain identifies the nearest target and expels all other entities. The target is completely immobilized (Slowness & Jump Block) during the 31-second active phase, forcing a true 1v1 confrontation.

[Adaptive Physics]: 🧱 Dynamic Terrain Reconstruction: The engine replaces the floor with "Domain Occulte" blocks that are indestructible and self-regenerating. Once the domain ends (or the caster/target dies), the terrain is perfectly restored to its original state.
